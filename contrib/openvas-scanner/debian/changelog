openvas-scanner (3.1.99.2-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Improved output of --version
    - Comprehensive code cleanup
    - Binary (.nes) plugins we moved to libraries and turned into builtin
      NASL methods.
    - Removed handling of binary plugins as we don't want to have them ever
      again.
    - Added preferences for the vhost feature so that clients get them
      and can offer them to the user. In other words: unhide the vhost feature.
    - Default port is now 9391 where the OpenVAS Manager expects the
      Scanner by default.
    - Command line options "--dump-cfg" and "--gen-config" are removed.
    - openvassd does not need anymore a "openvassd.conf" file. It uses
      its defaults and a possibly present conf-file can overwrite settings.
    - openvas-mkcert got a additional switch "-f" to force overwriting
      certificates.
    - openvas-mkcert does not create a openvassd.conf anymore as it shares
      the defaults with openvassd.
